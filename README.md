A tower defense game written with a lot of help from AI. This game is mostly playable, but completely unbalanced and probably a lot of bugs.

Here's a live copy of it you can try out.

The idea behind this game is that you choose the enemies to spawn. They have a cost and you get rewarded when you the tower kills them. You can use the points you earn to spend on spawning more or us it on tower upgrades.
